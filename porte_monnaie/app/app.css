    About: 
    App Created for Nativescript Uplabs competition.
    Using Nativescript Vue, and Pro UI (Charts, Listview & Calendar)
    The app uses static data, the focus was on building the UI and interactions,
    and not on the server side integration, more of Form than Function.
    Awesome learning experience, especially with the layouts and charts integration.
    It's quite easy to pickup with what you already know HTML, CSS and JS. I am happy with
    the results a good one for approx 12 hours of coding.
    Thanks to Team Nativescript for the awesome work, YOU GUYS ROCK! and the COMMUNITY for all the help.
    And thanks you guys/gals for reviewing my subsmission.
    Thanks UPLABS for the oppurtunity!
